# Chapter 1 Challenge Overview
Lloyds Banking Group is launching a new loans product. Prior to the launch I can use historical customer data to:
 - Task 1 Data Stategy: Understand and summarise the different behaviours or attributes between customers who paid back their loan and customers who did not
 - Taks 2 Data Science: To use the historical data to design a process which predicts the likelihood of a new customer not paying back their loan
